      T.p => T.raw "Well, there are things you want, like chocolate instead of vanilla, or a newer car, or for Christmas to come the day after Thanksgiving."
      T.p => T.raw "And there are things that you need: sleep, energy, health, prosperity, connection, achievement, and safety."
      T.p => T.raw "Getting the things you want are simple puzzles.  Once you figure out how to drive, you can pretty much drive anywhere. Personal transportation puzzle solved.  But do you Need to drive?  Pretty much everybody needs to drive in the US of A.  It is wired into our economy, culture and expectations."
      T.p => T.raw "So our puzzle of Transportation is now a problem.  But the parent’s old car is good for another few thousand miles and now the problem has gone away.  You decide to park overnight at the Mall after Thanksgiving dinner.  Christmas in November. Yippee."
      T.p => T.raw "But you have no money, since you are a “Young, Dumb, Broke High School Kid” and maybe have been for the last 30 years.  And so you get a job, and stop thinking about it."
      T.p => T.raw "Life goes on, and you drive to the Mall each Thanksgiving, until something happens and your car is impounded or worse, your license is forfeit.  Now you have a real problem.  The things that you need are no longer available."
      T.p => T.raw "Now you need to do something extreme.  That is the hallmark of a craving for a loss.  The amount of extremem things you might want to do to “solve” your problem.  Like push potatoes up the… Well, you figure what extreme things you may have done. Or think about doing."
      T.p => T.raw "And likely any of those extreme things will not really solve your problem.  Just as a veteran may want his leg back, it is a need that can never be completely satisfied."
      T.p => T.raw "Buddha is especially clear on the point of cravings — They are at the  heart of a person’s worst behavour and worst difficulties.  Even worse than missing Black Friday sales."
      T.p => T.raw "But you CAN still like chocolate instead of vanilla.  The Celarien says that Buddha would agree."
