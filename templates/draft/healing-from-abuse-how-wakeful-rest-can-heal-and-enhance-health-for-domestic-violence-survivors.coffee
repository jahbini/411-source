In the 70’s I did my doctoral dissertation on the psychophysiology of meditation and its implications for
psychotherapy. I was studying at a very traditional school, Northwestern University. And so in order to make my experimental research most meaningful to the academic ivy-league, I decided to use Chicago police officers as my subjects. I thought it would put my hypotheses up to a very rigorous test. Low and behold it did. And our results were statistically significant.
