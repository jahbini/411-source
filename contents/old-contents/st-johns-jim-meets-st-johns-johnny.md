Johnny plays guitar.  He drinks from musician cups mostly.  He may ask you what day it is.

He has been bounced regularly from his impromptu sidewalk concerts.  Maybe less so now.  That's good.

That's good because Johnny plays and sings.  More importantly he channels.  His gift is the ecstasy of forlorn anger that he puts into "House of the Rising Son."  Intense blood-popping anger of regret.  Makes Eric Burdon feel like a wimp.

He plays at various places in St. John's -- So get ready to get intense.  Intensity happens every now and then in this blood-popping angry regret of an economy.
