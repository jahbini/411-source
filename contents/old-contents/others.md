Your life is filled with other people.  You argue with your partner.  Your boss wants to examine every step of your job and you don't like that.  You don't seem to have control of your children.  Gossip at work or among your friends.

The common factor in these situations is you, and your emotional responses, and who is in charge, your emotional responses, or YOU.

Famed researchers like Jay Haley or Milton Erickson have found that most of our emotional responses are learned, yes learned, as infants, children or in school.  Those emotions didn't just get put there by magic, did they. So what if you could unlearn those emotional responses that just don't work anymore? And learn new ones that fit your current life?  Would you like that or what?
