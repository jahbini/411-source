I have a friend who is positive, helpful, outgoing and leaves people with positive experiences.  Let's call him Zorba the Muslim. Zorlim. His mantra is <quote>you want go? I take you!</quote>

He forms friendships with everyone, right up front.  Speaking very broken Japanese, he guides tourists and runs what is technically an illegal operation: no insurance, no chauffeurs license, etc, etc...  In his defense, he is quick to point out that he only escorts his friends, not customers. He gives great value and does not take advantage of anyone.

In his care, these new friends get the very best of Japanese protocol: he solves their problems, he finds their forgotten passports or cell phones, expedites tickets, picks them up when they pass out at the bar at two in the morning.  Everyone gets to the airport on time, safely and feels like they have a new family on Saipan.  He truly earns confidence, becomes the protective and helpful brother, uncle or son for the duration, and beyond.  And yes, occasionally the temporary husband.  And beyond.

His casual network goes back for twenty years of life guard work at Saipan's classy hotels.  He knows the system from runway to grotto, from airport to ocean, and makes sure his clients get all the benefits in between.

His wider circle of friends get these positive benefits, and more.  Zorlim is likely the most reliable guy on Saipan, in spite of his seemingly erratic methods of advanced Pashando-Pashando which is the local expression for "I'm going to a bunch of places for no particular reason and enjoy the ride."

On the downside, his Pashando-Pashando methods also allow him to juggle several Japanese members of his extended "temporary" family: those temporary wives I mentioned earlier.  Let's just call them mermaids.  Zorlim gathers them at the shoreline.

He is very open with them from the very first, like I said he doesn't take advantage of anyone.  If asked directly, he never lies about his marriage status.  He shows everybody the pix of his kids.

At worst, he tells you what want to hear, but he is quite up-front about that, too.  It's not "ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies," but rather "I have lot kind friend: business friend, family friend, sex friend, too. What kind friend you want?  No problem. I take care you."  His personal life is a complicated juggle.  It likely gets him down sometimes.  It gets him up, mostly.

I've asked him several times what he wants in the future: what he wants to be, do, or have five or ten years from now.  And his answer has always been: "whatever Allah give me... My uncle say I be successful, I believe him."

He seems to have little desire but only passion.  Sex, reggae, and the delight of learning how to be all things to all people as a tour guide.
 
This brings me to the question, is this a spiritually blessed life or one that is spiritually becalmed? At peace, he is. All while juggling the complicated interactions of his seriously conflicting commitments. His path may lead nowhere, but where should a path lead?  Does my path lead there?  Yours?  He says his goal is to "learn many things about many people."  He wants it on his tombstone.

He will leave no lasting impression on humanity, and he is totally OK with that.  Seemingly, that would be inconceivable for him.  Unless Allah makes it so.<br /><br /><a href="{{assets}}images/-120959.jpg"><img src="{{assets}}images/-120959.jpg" alt="20131129-120959.jpg" class="alignnone size-full" /></a>Zorlim takes two snorkeling novices to Forbidden Island.
